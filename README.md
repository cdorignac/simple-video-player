## Getting Started


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.


We get the tools we depend upon via npm, the [node package manager][npm].

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the tests
